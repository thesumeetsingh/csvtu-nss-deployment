          The Motto of NSS <strong>"Not Me But You"</strong>, reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for self-less service.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The logo for the NSS is based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world-famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Odisha. The Red & Blue colors in the logo inspire NSS volunteers to be active, energetic, and socially conscious. It portrays the cycle of creation, preservation, and releaseâ€”symbolizing continuity and the constant striving for social change.

            The NSS badge represents 24 hours of service, denoted by the 8 bars in the wheel. The red colour symbolizes youthful energy and enthusiasm, while the navy blue colour reflects the vast cosmos, in which NSS is a small but significant part committed to the welfare of humanity.
